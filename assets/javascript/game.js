//Much like Word Guess Game, instead player will guess numbers.

//Display 4 images of crystals(red, purple, orange, yellow (image file).
//Each crystal to have random # "hidden" values. ARRAY: 1-12.
//Player shown RANDOM # at start of game. ARRAY: 19-120. FO LOOP?
//Use ON(CLICK) for each Crystal, # RANDOMLY chosen (ARRAY). FOR LOOP?
//Create TOTAL SCORE. Points to INCREMENTAL add.
    //Player clicks on crystal, VALUE is hidden, but added to the TOTAL SCORE. FOR Loop?
//Wins IF total score === (matches) the random number from the start of game.
//Loses IF total score > the random number.
//Game RESTARTS if win or loss, and new random number appears. Crystals to have new hidden values. FOR LOOP?
//User's score will RESET to 0.
//Overall score...Display WINS and LOSSES, FOR LOOP. 
//Game automatically goes into another GAME -- Overal score is kept and tracked. But values are refreshed.
