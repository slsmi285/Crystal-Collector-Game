Crystal Collector Game using JQuery

Instructions:
The player will have to guess the answer, just like in a Word Guess.  The player will guess with numbers instead of letters.
There will be 4 crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When the player clicks one, the score counter for the player will be updated.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game!
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
Game ends.

If the player wants to play again, the player should see a new random number, and the crystals will have 4 new hidden values.
